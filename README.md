# Magic8 Languages

The developers of Magic8 have spent the past few weeks moving all messages into this repository. In addition, Magic8 directly pulls its languages from here and works pretty fast. Come join the project and help translate Magic8!

\**Please note that we are **not** looking for complete translations! Although we'd greatly appreciate that, we aren't rushing you to complete the entire English file translated in one night.*

\**Please also note that **English** is the most accurate and up to date language. It is up to other translators to match their languages with the English file. We have a **News Channel** in our [Support Server](https://magic8.xyz/discord) that posts all updates of the **en.json** file.*

## Instructions
- Double check to make sure your language is present
- Create a fork of this repository and/or store the English file ([en.json](https://github.com/OfficialMagic8/Languages/blob/master/languages/en.json)) file on your computer

- Please make sure you understand [Markdown](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-)
- Translate the English (en.json) to your fluently known language
- Submit a pull request or send a file to be reviewed and then approved

Please only translate files to your known language if you are already **somewhat fluent** in English. This way, you can understand the grammar and make proper changes. If you ever have a question about a word or phrase, do not hesitate to contact support.

There are still quite a few commands that do not support translations. It is tedious work that will be done when the developers have the time to do so.

## Placeholders Information

To get data that can't be translated, placeholders are used in the form of {PLACEHOLDER}. Again, please do not edit these at all, only move them for grammatical purposes.

Here is a list of the global placeholders (placeholders that are always the same everywhere). Be sure to check for updates here!

| Placeholder | Value                 |

| {INFO}      | Info Emoji            |
| {LOADING}   | Loading Emoji         |
| {WARNING}   | Warning Emoji         |
| {BOT}       | @Magic8               |
| {BOTNAME}   | Magic8                |

| {PREFIX}    | Server Prefix         |
